Two Trimester focus planning

**how you used N@tM to capture test data to be used in trimester 3**
- We got more data to our database, granting our users more workers to hire.
**from feedback, something you will add to your project?**
- We will add a dropdown menu for coding languages so people don't have to type in a language manually.
**other?**
- So many people came at the end
- Blog/article on you and your team

reflection on glows/grows from your demo/presentations
- Grows: We will make sure that we have kept the project maintained because some stuff can be maintained a lot more properly. We should also add a dropdown menu for languages when searching for workers
- Glows: So many people showed up due to many interesting features, like a video meeting feature attracted a lot of people.

Blog on event
- I have encountered many interesting projects, like 3D Animation Projects about a face mask and a beautiful scenary. There were a lot of people who were playing around with our website, while giving positive comments and feedback. We had a lot of fun.

something you saw in CompSci that impressed:
Raymond Sheng and Aiden Huynh's Project: (That group had really interesting features, like a statistic feature)

something you saw outside of CompSci that you liked:
- I have seen some 3D Animation Projects that are really appealing. There was a scenery that had a stylistic house, along with a realistic background and there was a well-designed face mask as well.
