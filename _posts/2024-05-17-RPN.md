## My Expression √((400/100)^4) * 5 + 10/2

-  [√, (, (, 400, /, 100, ), ^, 4, ), *, 5, +, 10, /, 2]
- We will turn the expression into reversed polish notation:
- 400, 100, / We do that first since 400 and 100 are the first numbers that are being maniuplated and division is the first operator and first set of closed set of parenthesis
- We will continue the process as we notice that it is being taken to the power of 4 so:
- 400, 100, /, 4, ^; In this process the expression is being taken to the power of 4 so this will then become the second operator coming into playu
- 400, 100, /, 4, ^, √; Since square root is covering up the second set of parenthess covering the previous expression, square root comes next and becomes the third operator
- Then the next expression is being multiplied by 5 so its 5 coming next followed by * leading into:
- 400, 100, /, 4, ^, √, 5, *
- What happens next is that the expression is going to be added by 10/2, since 10/2 comes first according to PEMDAS we write it as (10,2,/) then we have the + at the end to finish the addition. Finally this results in:
- 400, 100, /, 4, ^, √, 5, *, 10, 2, /, +

## Now for order of operations
- 400 and 100 and / are first in the list and since 400 is in front of 100, it's going to end up 400 being divided by 100:
- 4, 4, ^, √, 5, *, 10, 2, /, +
- Since 4 and 4 and ^ are first and since 4 is in front of 4, it going to end up having 4 to the power of 4:
- 256, √, 5, *, 10, 2, /, +
Since 256 is in front of square root, we take the square root of 256, which we get 16
- 16, 5, *, 10, 2, /, +
- Since 4 and 5 and * are next and 4 is in front of 5, we multiply these guys together:
- 80, 10, 2, / +
- This is where things get tricky, there is a number in front of 20 and 10 so we move on to 10 and 2, but we see 10 and 2 in front of /, so we divide 10 by 2 resulting in:
- 80,5,+
- As a result:
- 85
