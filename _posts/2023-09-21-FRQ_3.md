## Approach


To code a Java static method called arraySum for calculating the sum of entries in a specified one-dimensional array, I would start by defining the method within a Java class. The method would take an integer array as a parameter. Inside the method, I would initialize a variable, such as sum, to zero. Then, I'd use a for loop to iterate through the elements of the input array, adding each element's value to the sum in each iteration. After processing all the elements, I would return the sum as the result. Next, I would create a main method or use an existing one to demonstrate the usage of the arraySum method. Inside main, I would declare an example array (in this case, arr1) with the provided data. Finally, I would call the arraySum method with arr1 as an argument and print the returned sum to the console using System.out.println. This approach would allow the code to calculate and display the sum of the elements in the arr1 array, as specified in the prompt.

## Approach

Approaching the task of coding the rowSums method involves analyzing the problem statement and understanding the requirement to calculate the sums of rows in a two-dimensional array. The initial steps would include defining the method's signature and establishing variables for tracking the number of rows and the resulting array for storing row sums. A nested loop structure would be implemented to iterate through each row and its elements, calculating the sum for each row and recording it in the result array. This comprehensive approach would ensure that the method correctly handles the task of summing rows in the input array, with comments providing clarity throughout the code. Thorough testing, including edge cases, would be conducted to validate the code's correctness and robustness.

```java
public class ArraySumCalculator {

    // This is a static method that calculates and returns the sum of elements in an integer array.
    public static int arraySum(int[] arr) {
        int sum = 0; // Initialize a variable to store the sum of elements, starting at zero.
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            // Iterate through the elements of the input array.
            sum += arr[i]; // Add the current element to the sum.
        }
        return sum; // Return the calculated sum as the result.
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr1 = {1, 3, 2, 7, 3}; // Declare and initialize an example array with data.
        int sum = arraySum(arr1); // Call the arraySum method to calculate the sum of elements in arr1.
        System.out.println("Sum of the elements in arr1: " + sum); // Print the result to the console.
    }
}

ArraySumCalculator.main(null);
```

Sum of the elements in arr1: 16
